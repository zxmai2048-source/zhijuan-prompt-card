- Current real README banner JSON readiness audit: pass, `tmp/real-image-tests/readme-banner-json-readiness-v032-semantic-pass.json`, re-parsed real API output captured in `tmp/real-image-tests/readme-banner-json-readiness-v032.json`; returned `reconstruction_v2`, no hidden Japanese or duplicate recreation-prompt fields, `en.prompt` was 399 words, `json_prompt.generation_prompt` was 455 words, `json_prompt.generation_negative_prompt` had 24 blockers, `json_prompt.spatial_dynamics` was 55 words, and anchors for visible product text, bilingual UI labels, JSON tab, left/right panel layering, and layout-drift blockers all passed.
- Model-level real soft-focus nightlife rerun: pass, `tmp/real-image-tests/soft-focus-nightlife-v032.json`; returned `json_prompt.fidelity_priorities`, no hidden Japanese or duplicate recreation-prompt fields, `en.prompt` was 286 words, negative prompt had 23 image-specific blockers, and the English prompt covered soft focus, bloom/halation, phone-photo compression, and anti-commercial-sharpness drift.
- Manual real-extension UI test: pass, `npm run test:real-extension`, `tmp/browser-tests/manual-real-extension-summary-1781794736605.json`; loaded the built extension in a temporary Chromium profile, saved and tested the real BridgeDeck settings with redacted test evidence, then analyzed project README images through page image pick and local file upload. Both returned `reconstruction_v2`, `en.prompt`, `json_prompt.generation_prompt`, `json_prompt.generation_negative_prompt`, `json_prompt.spatial_dynamics`, `json_prompt.fidelity_priorities`, dynamic `observation_units`, dynamic `reconstruction_priorities`, no hidden Japanese output, and no duplicate recreation-prompt field.

Local upload returned 370 English prompt words, 459 JSON generation prompt words, 60 spatial dynamics words, 9 observation units, and 5 reconstruction priorities.
- Codex Thread cold review: pass, thread `019edac0-9340-78b3-9a59-069fd6c3aeab`; the reviewer found no blocker for user refresh acceptance, flagged the steam-to-splash overconstraint risk, then confirmed the follow-up fix after `npm run check:json-repair`, `npm run check:prompt-goal`, `npm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- Installed-extension acceptance checklist: ready, `docs/installed-extension-acceptance.md`.
- User refreshed-extension acceptance test: pending. Before merge, push, tag, or GitHub release, refresh or reload the user's installed browser extension and repeat at least one local image upload plus one page image selection through the actual UI.
- v0.3.2 scope: prompt-output optimization, `en.prompt` as the primary recreation prompt, JSON-local copy-ready generation prompt, JSON-local negative prompt, JSON-local spatial dynamics, dynamic reconstruction evidence in JSON output, plain-language fidelity priorities, input image detail preservation before analysis, removal of redundant hidden Japanese and duplicate recreation-prompt outputs from new model responses, stronger visible appearance fidelity, conditional camera/style/quality guidance, negative prompt blocker limits, API compatibility, and update notices.
- Release status: not tagged, not merged, not pushed, and not published. This build stops at user refreshed-extension acceptance before any GitHub release.
